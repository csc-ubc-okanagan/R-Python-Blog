knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

Color schemes are a matter of preference, but I think many of us can agree that RStudio's default theme is quite bright and low-contrast. Fortunately, RStudio offers some alternative themes, which you can see by clicking on `Tools > Global Options` in the top ribbon menu in RStudio. You can then select `Appearance` and change the Editor theme.

Of the default themes, the Cobalt theme is my preferred one, but I find some of the colors to be too similar (such as the white for general text and the light blue used for headings in `R` Markdown documents). You can find the custom theme I use [on my GitHub page](https://github.com/StefanoMezzini/misc/blob/main/Black%20Rmd.rstheme). To add use this theme, go to `Tools > Global Options`, then select `Appearance`, and click on `Add`. Finally, select the `Black Rmd.rstheme` file, and click on `Open`.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/dark-theme-example.png')
