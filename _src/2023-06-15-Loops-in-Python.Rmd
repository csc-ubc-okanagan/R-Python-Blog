Loops are a common tool used in Python to help users iterate through lists, or perform the same operation numerous times without added efforts.

Let's look at a few examples:

```{python}
# Loops

for n in [0, 1, 5, 2, -5]:
    # this is inside the loop
    print("The number is", n, "and its squared value is", n**2)
# this is outside the loop
```

```{python}
## Loop
s = "Python"
for c in s:
    print(c + "!")
```

```{python}
# range(10) sets values 0-9, because recall Python starts at 0, not 1
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

This is equivalent to writing:

```{python}
for i in range(0,10):
    print(i)
```

If we wanted it to start at 1 and go to 10 (inclusive), we would write:

```{python}
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)
```

Other examples:

```{python}
#(start,end,increments)
for i in range(0,101,10):
    print(i)
```

```{python}
n = 3
while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n = n - 1

print("Smile!")
```
